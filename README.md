The app is a Java-based web application featuring a home page, user, repair expert, and admin sections. It enables users to navigate through the website, interact with repair experts, and manage administrative tasks effectively.

1) Admin
   The admin section of the home page provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage repair experts.
   It allows admins to add new repair experts, search for existing ones, view a list of all repair experts, and control their availability 
   to users.
   Logging out ensures session security and redirects the admin to the main home page.
2) User
   The user section of the web application allows users to search for repair experts, submit repair requests, interact with repair experts, 
   and manage their repair requests. Logging in and signing up ensure secure user authentication and access to personalized features. 
   Users can view previous repair requests, submit new requests, review repair expert details, and take action based on repair amount.
   The User Home Page serves as a central hub for these interactions, while session management ensures security and proper logout 
   functionality.
3) Repair Experts
   Repair experts benefit from a dedicated portal for managing repair requests. They receive request details, provide repair estimates, and 
   update repair statuses, enhancing efficiency and customer engagement. The admin functionality empowers app owners to manage repair 
   expert profiles, ensuring quality control and personalized access.

   Overall, the app employs Java Beans, Servlets, JSP, and MySQL for the backend, coupled with CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap for the frontend. This blend of technologies delivers a responsive and visually appealing experience. With features such as user authentication, request tracking, and secure logout, the app fosters trust and reliability in gadget repair services.
